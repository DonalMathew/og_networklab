### Algorithm to Generate Intermediate Code for an Expression

**Input:** 
- A file containing an expression with operators and operands.
- Example expression: `"a + b * c - d"`

**Output:** 
- Intermediate code for the given expression.

**Steps:**

1. **Initialize File Pointers**:
   - Open the input file for reading.
   - Open the output file for writing.

2. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Create an array `tokens[][]` to store tokens (operators and operands).
   - Create an array `tokenType[]` to store the type of each token (0 for operand, 1 for operator, 2 for number).
   - Initialize `currentIndex` to 0, which keeps track of the position in the tokens array.

3. **Read and Classify Tokens**:
   - While there are tokens left in the input file:
     1. Read the next token.
     2. Copy the token into the `tokens[][]` array.
     3. Determine the type of token:
        - If the token is a digit, classify it as `number` (type 2).
        - If the token is an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), classify it as `operator` (type 1).
        - Otherwise, classify it as `operand` (type 0).
     4. Increment `currentIndex` by 1.
   - Store the total number of tokens in `totalTokens`.

4. **Initialize Intermediate Code Variables**:
   - Set `useCapital` to 0, which tracks whether a temporary variable is currently in use.
   - Set `tempVariable` to 65 (ASCII code for 'A'), which will be used to name temporary variables.

5. **Generate Intermediate Code**:
   - Traverse the `tokens[]` array in reverse (starting from `totalTokens` down to 0):
     1. If the current token is an operand and it's at the end of the expression:
        - Print `tempVariable = operand` and increment `tempVariable`.
        - Set `useCapital` to 1.
     2. If the current token is an operator followed by a number:
        - Print `tempVariable = operand operator tempVariable-1`.
        - Increment `tempVariable` and move to the next token.
        - Set `useCapital` to 1.
     3. If the current token is an operator followed by an operand, and a temporary variable is in use:
        - Print `tempVariable = operand operator tempVariable-1`.
        - Increment `tempVariable`, move to the next token, and reset `useCapital`.
     4. If the current token is an operator followed by an operand, and no temporary variable is in use:
        - Print `tempVariable = operand operator operand`.
        - Increment `tempVariable`.
     5. If the current token is a number and no temporary variable is in use:
        - Print `tempVariable = number` and increment `tempVariable`.
     6. If the current token is a number and a temporary variable is in use:
        - Print `tempVariable = operand operator tempVariable-1`.
        - Increment `tempVariable`, move to the next token, and reset `useCapital`.

6. **Output Intermediate Code**:
   - Print the intermediate code to the console.

7. **Close Files**:
   - Close the input and output files.

8. **End**.

This algorithm covers the main steps to convert an arithmetic expression into intermediate code, handling operator precedence and the use of temporary variables.
